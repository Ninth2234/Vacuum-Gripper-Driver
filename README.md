## üìò Overview

This project provides the design files, electrical connections, and control instructions for a pneumatic actuator assembly.  
The module consists of:
- A **pneumatic linear actuator**  
- A **solenoid valve (5/2 or 3/2 type)**  
- **Air tubing and fittings**  
- **Electrical control wiring**

The goal is to create a plug-and-play actuator unit for testing and integration in mechatronic systems.
